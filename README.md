# pkgst

Packagist is a polyglot dependency system. It's built to be language agnostic; where you fetch dependencies, Packagist may be able to:

- ⏩ **Accelerate downloads of dependencies**
- ✅ **Verify authenticity of dependencies**
- 🔒 **Offer stronger transport security**
- 🔥 **Cache dependencies near your builds and CLI**
- 🕵️ **Report your dependency usage to you**

## Supported ecosystems

Packagist currently supports **JVM** and **JavaScript** ecosystems of package registries, with more to come:

| Ecosystem   | Repository           | Endpoint                        |
